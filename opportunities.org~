** <2017-07-08 Sat 06:28> OPPORTUNITY: Sr. .Net Developer (Sure shot Closer)
Boston, MA
Eaton Vance
Local
6 Months
 
Not looking for Web Developers, this is Data Driven and there will be a lot of support work.   Financial Services is a Big Plus.
 
This is a support heavy development role, there will be some new development for current and upcoming projects but mostly supporting, maintaining and fixing things.
Main focus is on a “jack of all trades” who can work on multiple, concurrent projects, again mostly support related—not too senior.
Preference is for a data driven developer who can jump on “a million little things” and work on multiple projects at once.
 
 
Important Skills
Technical – C#, SQL, .net would be a plus; must have strong middle and back end development experience
Soft – strong technical ability, understanding of business/financial concepts, team player attitude, willing to do support work along with new development projects
 
 
 
Day to Day
 
The main skills are SQL and C#:

    SQL: a big percentage of what this team does is getting data in or out of a database or tweaking SQL queries like views, stored procedures and writing complex queries.

    C#: if something breaks or isn’t working correctly they will be tasked with looking at the code to fix or determine root problem by looking at the C# code

 
Looking for 8-10 year candidate who can work within their Agile/Kanban environment with excellent communication skills. They want someone in this range of experience as he feels they will be more energetic about this type of support work.
 
Additional notes:
Anyone with lead/director/management experience is not going to be a fit for this per the manager
People who has worked on completely web-based or web design projects recently are not going to be a fit. This team does nothing related to web.
As long as candidates have strong communication skills they will be considered.
 
Job Description

    C#/SQL; ideally a full stack developer who has some .net as well.
    Could be a junior resource if the tech stack is right. Manager is open to adding a junior team member if the person is right
    Replacing current contractor (keep that confidential for now)
    Working with Fixed Income trading systems, Bloomberg, CRD, Barclays, etc. is a plus
    Similar environments at GMO, Wellington, State Street, Charles River, MFS

Warm Regards…

** <2017-09-11 Mon 09:36> OPPORTUNITY: InterviewJet
Hi Ray,

I know this might not be the first time you've heard from (or about) InterviewJet, but I really wanted to connect with you! I'm Hunter, and as a Talent Marketing Manager, it's my job to find passion-driven + talented folks...so you're hard for me to ignore.

We send out a weekly, hand-picked flight of kick-ass talent that we connect with over 400 top tech companies in Boston. Because you're one of only 10-15 candidates per week, we're able to send those flights directly to decision makers (we're talking CEOs, CTOs, VPs) and there's no doubt you'd catch their eye as much as you have mine.

I'd love to talk about featuring you on our platform. Any chance you've got 15 minutes to chat?

P.S. Interested in NYC? We're there too!

All the best,
Hunter Morales
Talent Marketing Manager
307 W 38th Street
Suite 1315
New York, NY 10018

- Answer to Deb

deb.calderone1112@gmail.com

Hi Deb

Yeah they do have even more options than when I previously looked.  When I worked at Dining Alliance, part of my role was as a Salesforce Administrator (which also included some Salesforce development).  

Looking at the new site the Business Analyst track is where I would start if you are looking for a BA role. It seems they have set it up to gradually introduce progressively  more advance topics as you "follow the trail".

Also every year they have DreamForce which costs money, but the Salesforce World tour in the  Spring is free and you just have to register and you can learn a lot if you decide to continue in this direction.

Regards
Ray Nieva
